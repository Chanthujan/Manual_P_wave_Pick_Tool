# Manual Pick Tool for P-Wave Detection
## Overview
The Manual Pick Tool is specifically designed to support the evaluation of P-wave detection algorithms by enabling precise manual picking of P-wave arrival times, calculation of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), and padding of noise data for comprehensive processing. This tool is integral to our research efforts in improving the accuracy and reliability of Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS).

## Features
  1. Picking P-Wave Arrival Time: Manually identify the exact start of P-waves on vertical acceleration waveforms.
  2. Calculation of PGA for P-Waves: Calculate the PGA using the manually picked P-wave start point and user input on the duration of the P-wave.
  3. Padding Noise Data for Processing: Padding additional noise data to increase the length of the noise data to facilitate the algorithm processing.
